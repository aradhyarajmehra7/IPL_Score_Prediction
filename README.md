## IPL SCORE 1st INNINGS PREDICTION
Predicting the score of IPL has always been a tedious task for a layman, but this webapp can simplify it!
This project involved a linear regression algorithm to train and Flask framework to deploy the model on Heroku, however the important files such as requirement.txt and PROCFILE is not been uploaded.
This is one of my first project to practise a hand on deploying the model on microservice framework
## KEY LEARNINGS FROM PROJECT
    * Linear Regression
    * HTML
    * Flask Framework and Heruko
## Follow Ups
    * Would love trying to deploy on AWS EC2 instance
    * Would use Lasso Regression
    * Can also train the model through DecisionTree
